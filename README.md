Notes, etc, for Kaggle RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge

This repository contains the basic file structure and most of the files 
used for my entry in the competition.  It does not include the files 
that take a lot of space, such as the weights file and the full set 
of data files. In general, the "darknet" directory pertains to the training 
and use of the model, and the "rsna" directory pertains to the pre- and
post processing of the data. The Jupyter notebook in the root of the
repo just illustrates some of the explanation given here.
